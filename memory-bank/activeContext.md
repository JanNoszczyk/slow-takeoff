# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on refining the consolidated `app.py` by replacing the placeholder mock API implementation with strongly-typed Pydantic models based on the `components.json` schema. This ensures the mock API adheres to the expected data structures.

## Recent Changes

-   **Consolidation:** Merged the browser bridge, OData gateway, and mock Vidar API into a single `app.py`.
-   **Dependencies:** Updated `requirements.txt`.
-   **Cleanup:** Removed redundant `odata_gateway.py` and `mock_api/` directory.
-   **Docker Config:** Updated `docker-compose.yml` for the single service.
-   **Pydantic Integration:** Replaced the simple mock models and data generation in `app.py` with Pydantic models derived from `components.json`. The mock endpoints now return example data conforming to these models.

## Next Steps

1.  Update `progress.md` to reflect the Pydantic model integration.
2.  Verify the application runs correctly with the new models (e.g., `docker-compose up`).
3.  Address any potential runtime errors or the persistent Pylance linting issues if they impact functionality.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

-   The mock API endpoints now return static example data based on `components.json` examples, ignoring OData query parameters like `$filter`, `$select`, etc., for simplicity.
-   Persistent Pylance errors in `app.py` related to Enum definitions were observed but might be transient; monitoring if they affect runtime.
