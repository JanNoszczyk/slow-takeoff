# Active Context

## Current Focus

*   Implementing and testing the "Dynamic Tailwind Build" approach to render agent-generated TSX components with Tailwind styling.
*   This involves the API route running the Tailwind CLI at runtime to generate CSS specific to the agent's TSX output.
*   The frontend then compiles the TSX (using Babel Standalone) and injects the dynamically generated CSS.

## Recent Changes & Decisions

*   **Problem:** Initial attempts to render agent-generated TSX using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` failed to apply Tailwind styles due to Tailwind's build-time nature.
*   **Experiment 1 (Browser Compilation):** Implemented client-side TSX compilation using `@babel/standalone`. Added the library, modified `page.tsx` to compile and render. Testing was blocked by the user.
*   **Experiment 2 (Iframe):** Modified `page.tsx` to use an `<iframe>` and updated the API route (`route.ts`) to generate a full HTML page including CDN scripts (React, Babel, Tailwind) for the iframe content. Testing was blocked by the user.
*   **Experiment 3 (Dynamic Tailwind Build - Current):**
    *   Reverted `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` from the iframe approach.
    *   Re-added `@babel/standalone` script to `layout.tsx`.
    *   Rewrote API route (`route.ts`) to: handle GET, run Python pipeline, save TSX to temp file, run `npx tailwindcss` CLI against temp file to generate CSS, read CSS, return `{ tsx, css }` JSON.
    *   Rewrote `page.tsx` to: fetch `{ tsx, css }` JSON, compile TSX with Babel, inject CSS into a `<style>` tag, render the compiled element.
*   **Decision:** Pursuing the complex "Dynamic Tailwind Build" approach despite performance concerns, as per user insistence on rendering agent-generated TSX with Tailwind.

## Next Steps

*   **Test Current Implementation:** Start the dev server (if not running) and test the "Dynamic Tailwind Build" approach by generating a dashboard in the browser. Verify if the component structure is rendered correctly and if the Tailwind styles are applied.
*   **Evaluate Performance:** Assess the API response time, as running Tailwind CLI on each request is expected to be slow.
*   **Address Issues:** Debug any errors arising from the API route (file I/O, Tailwind execution) or frontend (Babel compilation, CSS injection, rendering).

## Open Questions & Considerations

*   **Performance Viability:** Is the performance overhead of the Dynamic Tailwind Build acceptable?
*   **Scalability/Reliability:** Is this runtime build process robust enough for production use?
*   **Alternative Styling:** If performance is unacceptable, reconsidering inline styles or custom CSS (generated by agent or defined manually) might be necessary if the JSON data approach remains off the table.
*   **Security:** Compiling and rendering runtime-generated code (TSX) and injecting runtime-generated CSS requires careful security review.
*   **Dashboard Scope:** Still need to decide how to handle other dashboard parts (quote, summary) if the news section rendering is resolved.
