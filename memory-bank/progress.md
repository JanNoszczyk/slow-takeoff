# Progress

## What Works (Confirmed)

-   **Consolidated Service:** The application (`app.py`) now integrates the Browser Bridge, OData Gateway, and Mock Vidar API functionalities into a single FastAPI service.
-   **Containerization:** `Dockerfile` is set up to build the consolidated service environment.
-   **Orchestration:** `docker-compose.yml` is configured to run the single `browser-n8n-bridge` service, mapping port 24006 and injecting necessary environment variables (`VIDAR_BASE_URL`, `VIDAR_API_KEY`, LLM keys, etc.).
-   **API Layer:**
    -   Browser Bridge endpoints (`/api/v1/...`) for task management are defined.
    -   OData Gateway endpoint (`/gateway/myodata/...`) forwards requests to the configured `VIDAR_BASE_URL` with the `VIDAR_API_KEY`.
    -   Mock Vidar API endpoints (`/mock_api/v1/...`) are defined for Assets, Portfolios, Positions, Transactions, and PortfolioDailyMetrics.
-   **Mock API Typing:** The Mock Vidar API endpoints now use Pydantic models generated from `components.json` for response validation and return static example data conforming to these models. The previous basic mocks have been removed.
-   **Core Logic:** Browser automation tasks still use `browser_use.Agent` driven by Langchain LLMs.
-   **Configuration:** Uses `.env` and environment variables.
-   **Task Management:** In-memory task tracking for the browser bridge remains.
-   **Dependencies:** `requirements.txt` includes all necessary packages (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic`, `httpx`, `browser-use`, Langchain providers, `python-dotenv`).

## What's Left to Build / Verify

1.  **Environment Setup:** Ensure the `.env` file is populated with necessary API keys (LLM keys, `VIDAR_BASE_URL`, `VIDAR_API_KEY`).
2.  **Docker Build & Run:** Build (`docker-compose build`) and run (`docker-compose up`) the consolidated service. Monitor logs (`docker-compose logs -f`).
3.  **Service Verification:** Check that all parts of the service are operational:
    -   Browser Bridge: `http://localhost:24006/api/v1/ping` and potentially run a test task.
    -   OData Gateway: `http://localhost:24006/gateway/ping` and potentially test forwarding to a mock endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:24006/gateway/myodata/Assets`).
    -   Mock Vidar API: Access mock endpoints directly (e.g., `http://localhost:24006/mock_api/v1/Assets`). Check if data conforms to Pydantic models.
4.  **Testing:** Run `test_api.py` (if still applicable/updated) or perform manual API calls to test integration.

## Current Status

-   Consolidation of services into `app.py` is complete.
-   Mock Vidar API has been refactored to use Pydantic models based on `components.json`, replacing the previous implementation.
-   Configuration files (`docker-compose.yml`, `requirements.txt`) are updated.
-   Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) reflect the current architecture.
-   Ready to build, run, and verify the consolidated service in Docker.

## Known Issues

-   **Volatile State:** Browser bridge task state is in-memory.
-   **Configuration Dependency:** Service requires `.env` configuration for full functionality (LLM keys, Vidar connection details).
-   **Pylance Errors:** Persistent Pylance errors reported in `app.py` after refactoring, potentially transient or minor syntax issues not caught by basic checks. Need to monitor during runtime.
-   **Mock API Limitations:** Mock endpoints return static example data and do not implement OData query options (`$filter`, `$select`, etc.).
-   **README Discrepancy:** `README.md` might still reflect the old structure or non-Docker setup.
