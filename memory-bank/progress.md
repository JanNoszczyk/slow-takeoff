# Project Progress

## Current Status

*   **State:** Attempting to implement the "Dynamic Tailwind Build" architecture. The API route (`route.ts`) has been modified to run the Python pipeline, save the resulting TSX, execute the Tailwind CLI, and return `{ tsx, css }` JSON. The frontend (`page.tsx`) has been modified to fetch this JSON, compile the TSX using Babel Standalone, inject the CSS, and render the result.
*   **Milestones:**
    *   Successfully debugged initial pipeline execution errors.
    *   Successfully refactored the architecture to incorporate dynamic TSX generation (initial version).
    *   Implemented (but did not fully test) browser-side compilation and iframe approaches.
    *   Implemented the "Dynamic Tailwind Build" approach in code.

## What Works (Presumed)

*   **`stonk_research_agent`:** Gathers research data and produces JSON.
*   **`project_agents/dashboard_agent`:** Generates TSX code string for news boxes.
*   **`run_pipeline.py`:** Orchestrates agent calls and outputs the TSX string.

## What's Left to Build / Verify

*   **Test Dynamic Tailwind Build:** The current implementation needs testing to see if it functions correctly and if the performance is acceptable.
*   **Define Full Scope:** `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` are still undefined.
*   **Complete Dashboard UI:** Still only focuses on the news section. Other elements are not handled.
*   **Error Handling:** Needs significant improvement for the complex API route logic (Python, file I/O, Tailwind CLI) and frontend (fetch, Babel, CSS injection).
*   **Security Review:** Assess risks of runtime compilation, CSS injection, and filesystem access in the API route.

## Known Issues & Bugs

*   **Styling Failure (Original):** Tailwind CSS styles were not applied when rendering agent-generated TSX via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. This prompted the recent architectural experiments.
*   **Performance Concern (Current):** The "Dynamic Tailwind Build" approach is expected to be very slow due to running the Tailwind CLI on every API request.
*   **Complexity (Current):** The current architecture is significantly complex and relies on unconventional runtime use of build tools.
*   **UI Incompleteness:** `page.tsx` currently only renders the dynamically generated news section.
